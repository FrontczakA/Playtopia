Playtopia is a Java Spring Framework project I am currently developing during my studies. It operates on a PostgreSQL database. Playtopia is an online game shop with the following planned features:
  -Users can view a paginated list of all games and filter them.
  -Users can view specific game details.
  -Users can add games to their shopping basket.
  -Users can purchase games with a simple shipping and payment system implementation.
  -Registration and logging in system
  -Admins can add new games, delete existing ones, and update game details.
 To run application compile code in IntelliJ and go to localhost:8080/games.
